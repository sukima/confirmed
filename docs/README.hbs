# Confirmed

A framework agnostic asynchronous confirmation module.

A very simple *promise-like* API for easily showing a confirmation and
resolving to the result of the user input. Its main goal is to replace or
enhance the typical `window.confirm` and many adhoc event based solutions (see
example below).

Special thanks to [FunnelCloud Inc.](http://funnelcloud.io/) for graciously
providing inspiration, R+D, and support.
